Hey, you can call me Ray.
• I like the following games: Terraria, Pokémon, GTA V, and Minecraft.
• Introvert, Semi-antisocial. DNI if you don't have the patience.
• Diagnosed with ADHD.

I probably won't update this bio often as I only use GitHub for certain repositories.
You can reach me on Discord under the handle "rayg13" (without the quotation marks, obviously).
